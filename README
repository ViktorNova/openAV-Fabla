This is the repository of a sampler plugin called Fabla.


== DEPENDENCIES
This plugin uses NTK for its interface. NTK can be obtained using
git clone git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/non/fltk.git ntk

Most other deps will already be installed on most systems:
cairo
cairomm-1.0
sndfile


== INSTALL
Once deps are satisfied, building and installing into ~/.lv2/ is easy,
just run make as usual:

make
make install


== RUNNING
After the INSTALL step Ardour3, QTractor, and any other LV2 host should
automatically find Fabla, and add it to the list of loadable plugins.

If you have the JALV LV2 host installed, the "run.sh" script can be used to
launch Fabla as a standalone JACK client.

$  ./run.sh
